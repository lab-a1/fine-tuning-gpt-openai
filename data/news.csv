""I know I'm not a young man, to state the obvious,"" he told a rally in the battleground state of North Carolina on Friday, one day after he struggled in the televised showdown with his Republican rival Donald Trump. ""I don’t walk as easy as I used to... I don’t debate as well as I used to,"" he acknowledged. ""But I know what I do know, I know how to tell the truth [and] I know how to do this job."" Mr Biden, 81, said he believed with his ""heart and soul"" that he could serve another term, as the cheering crowd in Raleigh chanted “four more years”. Trump, meanwhile, held a rally of his own in Virginia just hours later, where he hailed a ""big victory"" in the debate, which CNN said was viewed by 48 million people on television and millions more online. ""Joe Biden's problem is not his age,"" the 78-year-old Trump said. ""It's his competence. He's grossly incompetent."" The former president said he did not believe speculation that Mr Biden would drop out of the race, saying he ""does better in polls"" than other Democrats, including California Governor Gavin Newsom and Vice-President Kamala Harris.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cne4z2p7nl4o,bbc,1
