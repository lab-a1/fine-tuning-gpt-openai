""I know I'm not a young man, to state the obvious,"" he told a rally in the battleground state of North Carolina on Friday, one day after he struggled in the televised showdown with his Republican rival Donald Trump. ""I don’t walk as easy as I used to... I don’t debate as well as I used to,"" he acknowledged. ""But I know what I do know, I know how to tell the truth [and] I know how to do this job."" Mr Biden, 81, said he believed with his ""heart and soul"" that he could serve another term, as the cheering crowd in Raleigh chanted “four more years”. Trump, meanwhile, held a rally of his own in Virginia just hours later, where he hailed a ""big victory"" in the debate, which CNN said was viewed by 48 million people on television and millions more online. ""Joe Biden's problem is not his age,"" the 78-year-old Trump said. ""It's his competence. He's grossly incompetent."" The former president said he did not believe speculation that Mr Biden would drop out of the race, saying he ""does better in polls"" than other Democrats, including California Governor Gavin Newsom and Vice-President Kamala Harris.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cne4z2p7nl4o,bbc,1

In my rush to warn you all yesterday to shield your pension from political risk, what with all this electioneering business, I neglected the most important subject of them all: UK house prices.  The latest Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) update was as close to upbeat as we’ve got in recent house price data. Estate agents and surveyors now think that a recovery is firmly taking hold.  As you can see from our regularly posted chart below, estate agents’ net expectations for the next three months tend to be decent predictors of what actual house prices — as measured by Nationwide — will do.",https://bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-02-09/uk-house-prices-perk-up-but-stresses-remain?srnd=economics-v2,bloomberg,0
000652af46b11ea5ce8c44ea01b9e1bf0c371e668d83e105efd39833055020c4,Dying together: Why a happily married couple decided to stop living,,"Jan and Els were married for almost five decades. In early June, they died together after being given lethal medication by two doctors. In the Netherlands, this is known as duo-euthanasia. It’s legal, and it’s rare - but every year, more Dutch couples choose to end their lives this way.  Some people might find this article upsetting.  Three days before they voluntarily take their last breath, Jan and Els’ campervan sits on a sunlit marina in Friesland, in the Netherlands’ north. They’re a couple who love being mobile, and have lived most of their marriage in a motorhome, or on boats. “We tried sometimes [to live] in a pile of stones - a house,” jokes Jan, when I visit them, “but it doesn’t work.” He’s 70, and sits in the swivel driving-seat of the van, one leg bent underneath him in the only position that eases his continuous back pain. His wife, Els, is 71 and has dementia. Now, she struggles to formulate her sentences. “This is very good,” she says, standing up easily and pointing to her body. “But this is terrible,” she says, pointing to her head. Jan and Els met in kindergarten - theirs was a lifelong partnership. When he was young, Jan played hockey for the Netherlands’ national youth team, and then became a sports coach. Els trained as a primary school teacher. But it was their shared love of water, boats, and sailing that defined their years together. As a young couple they lived on a houseboat. They later bought a cargo boat and built a business transporting goods around the Netherlands’ inland waterways. Meanwhile, Els gave birth to their only son (who asked not to be named). He became a weekly boarder at school and spent weekends with his parents. During school holidays when their child was onboard too, Jan and Els looked for work trips that would take them to interesting places – along the river Rhine, or to the Netherlands’ islands. By 1999, the inland cargo business had become very competitive. Jan was experiencing serious back pain from the heavy-duty work he had been doing for more than a decade. He and Els moved on land, but after a few years they were again living on a boat. When that became too much to manage, they bought their spacious campervan. Jan had surgery on his back in 2003, but it didn’t improve. He had halted a heavy regime of pain killers and could no longer work, but Els was still busy teaching. Sometimes they talked about euthanasia - Jan explained to his family he didn’t want to live too long with his physical limitations. It was around this time the couple joined NVVE – the Netherlands’ “right to die” organisation. “If you take a lot of medicine, you live like a zombie,” Jan told me. “So, with the pain I have, and Els’ illness, I think we have to stop this.” When Jan says “stop this”, he means - stop living.
